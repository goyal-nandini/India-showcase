tasks creating something gateway to indian culture not so uch deep only slight highlights
choose a fevicon indian flag clearly shown out
choose a logo/img for our project at leftmost corner
choose header which has options like  (check in obove web)
then take pictures and put in a crousel
then one by one showcase pictures by using different layouts (bootstrap/above webpages)
can add a vedio on crousel may be
add a footer


use background-img property (check on mdn) 
for writing out text 

main goal is to create a good website titled as above but with different snippets from bootstarp or learning for yt, have not please make it to include these culture or that picture also do minimalistic of that adding but "less adding" "more feature" using is very important.

as if i am trying to clone the website but not fully but try to!!
